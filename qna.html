		<h1>What is this?</h1>
		<p>
			This is an practice tool for American Math Contests.
			<b>This is a work in progress! It is not finished yet!</b>.
		</p>
		<h1>How will it work?</h1>
		<p>
			The idea is to use scraper.py to scrape the <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com">Art of Problem Solving</a>
			website's wiki (known as AoPS Wiki). Since this wiki contains AMC 8, 10, 12, and AIME problems,
			we can the wiki to get the HTML code for the problems.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Once I get the HTML code for many AMC and AIME problems,
			the plan is to be able to display each of these problems on a white text box.
		<p>

		<p>
			Now, users can select whether they want to practice, AMC 8, AMC 10, AMC 12, or
			AIME problems. The user can also select the rough difficulty of the problem practiced.
			This difficulty is based on the problem number, since harder problems tend to be at the end of the test.
			The system will give them 5 of these problems to practice, but maybe users can select the amount they want.
		</p>

		<p>
			Also, I plan to somehow have a file that keeps track of which problems were solved, 
			so users don't solve the same problem again.
		</p>
		<h1>When will this be done?</h1>
		<p>
			No guaranteed time. The plan is to a prototype of how the website looks like first, and have some
			sample problems. Then, scrapping the problems will start...
