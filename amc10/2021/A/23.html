choosing at random the direction of each hop - up, down, left, or right. She does not hop diagonally. When the<br/>
direction of a hop would take Frieda off the grid, she “wraps around” and jumps to the opposite edge. For example<br/>
if Frieda begins in the center square and makes two hops “up,” the first hop would place her in the top row middle<br/>
square, and the second hop would cause Frieda to jump to the opposite edge, landing in the bottom row middle<br/>
square. Suppose Frieda starts from the center square, makes at most four hops at random, and stops hopping if she<br/>
lands on a corner square. What is the probability that she reaches a corner square on one of the four hops?<br/>
